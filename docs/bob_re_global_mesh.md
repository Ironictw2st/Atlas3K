# BOB global mesh and camera heightmap: reverse-engineering notes

These notes come from Ghidra decompiles of the assembly-kit DLLs. The decompiled C is in `research/bob_re/`:

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| `tooldatabuilder/` | Driver, per-tile builder, merger, cleaner |
| `mesh/`, `mesh2/` | Merger helpers |
| `camera/`, `camera_lambda/` | Camera heightmap |
| `warscape_height/` | Terrain height query |

**Tools.** Ghidra 12.1 and JDK 21 are installed portably in `Z:\Claude\Tools`, with the project in `ghidra_projects\bob`.

- **`ghidra_run.sh <dll> <outdir> <names~alt> <strings~alt> [max] [callee depth]`** decompiles functions from the saved project. Use `~` for regex alternation and `\s` for spaces, because the Windows batch launcher splits arguments on `;`, `,` and spaces.
- **`research/bob_re/disasm_calls.py`** shows the argument setup before a given call.
- **`research/bob_re/disasm_grep.py`** greps a disassembled function and resolves RIP-relative float constants.

## Camera heightmap (`TOOLDATABUILDER::generate_camera_height_map`, tooldatabuilder 0x180069e80)

**Settings** (`CAMERA_HEIGHT_MAP_SETTINGS`):

| Offset | Meaning |
|---|---|
| +0 | Samples per unit |
| +4 | Resolution scale relative to `terrain_size_in_tiles` |
| +8 | Blur on/off |
| +0xc | Kernel size |
| +0x10 | Sigma |

**Sampling:**
- Grid = tiles × scale. cellW = world width / cols, cellH = world height / rows.
- **Cell (x, y):** the rectangle is centred on (x·cellW, y·cellH) with half-size 0.5 × cell. Output cell (x, y) is element [y·cols + x].
- **Samples** (`FUN_18006bf20`): n = ceil(extent × samplesPerUnit) per axis, sampled from the min corner in steps of extent/n. The cell value is the max of `height(x, z)`, starting from −1.
- **Height query:** the scene terrain object's vtable slot 0xd0. See the terrain height section below.

**Output:**
- Highest = max over all cells, printed as "Highest Sampled Height".
- Pixel = ceil(max(h / highest, 0) × 65535).
- `height_scale` = highest × 1/65535.
- Optional separable blur, then saved as a 16-bit PNG.

**Native version** (`CameraHeightmapStep`):
- It uses lf max(h, 0) over 4×4 lf blocks plus rasterised props, with ceil conversion.
- This sampling fits vanilla best on prop-free terrain (80% of cells within 0.05). The corner-centred rectangle came out slightly worse, probably because BOB samples with bilinear interpolation.
- Over mountains, vanilla dlc07 follows an older prop layout, so it can't be matched there.

## Terrain height query (`WARSCAPE::TERRAIN_RENDER_SETUP::get_height_worker`, warscape 0x180371030)

- **Formula:** height = lf part + tile HF part, for the tile instance covering the point, as placed from `tile_list.bin`.
- **Tile-local coordinates:** tile px = x / tileSize − offset. The tile rectangle is (x, y, w, h) with w and h swapped for orientation 0x20 and 0x80. The local sub-tile index is rotated by the orientation (0x10, 0x20, 0x40 or 0x80).
- **Masking:** if the tile is masked and the sub-tile isn't valid, the tile contributes nothing at that point.
- **lf part:** a bilinear sample of the lf map × scale − offset.
- **HF part:** comes from `hf_height_map.compressed_map` (`get_high_frequency_height_new`), multiplied by the campaign HF scale (`this + 800`). If the tile has no HF raw data, the height comes from the tile mesh's high-frequency positions instead.
- **Vanilla campaign tiles:** mountain tiles have all-zero HF maps and flat `TerrainBase0` meshes (y = 0, skirts at −10). The relief is in the mountain **props**. Road and river tiles have small HF maps (range −1..0).

## Global mesh (`FUN_180124ed0`, driven by `TOOLDATABUILDER::process_terrain_global_mesh`)

### Tiling
- Battle size in tiles = `battle_size_in_tiles`, the tile-map grid (1784 × 1405 on dlc07).
- **Cells per mesh:** max(tiles) × 0.125 = 223. Grid vertices = 224 × 224 per mesh.
- **Meshes per axis:** 2 × max(tiles) / 223 = 16.
- **Cell size:** extent / (2 × max(tiles)), where extent = max(world w, h) = 595.1, so 0.16679.
- Meshes are built in a loop "Building mesh k of 256". Empty ones are skipped.

### Height grid
- Built by a parallel lambda (`FUN_180147cf0` / `FUN_180134a00`) into a float grid of 224², with −20.0 (`DAT_1804e3e14`) marking a hole.
- The heights come from the terrain query `FUN_18016ae30`. **Not yet decompiled.**

### Vertices
- Row-major: j (z) outer, i (x) inner.
- 0x94-byte records: +4 x = (i + mesh col × 223) × cell, +8 y = grid height, +0xc z = (j + mesh row × 223) × cell.
- Normals are at +0x44..+0x4c, computed by `FUN_180147860(heights, verts, 224, 0.33)`. **Not yet decompiled.**

### Triangles
- Visit quads (j, i) row-major, for i, j ≤ 223, where none of the four corners is −20.
- With a = j·224+i, b = a+1, c = a+224, d = c+1, emit [a, c, b] then [c, d, b].

### TRIANGLE_MERGER (`rigidmodel_optimise.cpp`)

**Call:** `process(factor = cos(conversion_params.angle × π/180), 64.0, FLT_MAX, flags)`. The log prints the factor as 0.9999.

**Setup:**
- Iterations N = min((uint)(64 × 1/6), 50) = 10. Step = 64 / N = 6.4.
- Initial vertex→triangle adjacency: `cfdb0` copies triangles into 12-byte records and appends each triangle's index to each corner's list, in triangle order.

**Iteration k** (k = 1..N): the edge limit is L = k × 6.4. The counter jumps by 10 when a pass removes nothing four times in a row. Then, for each vertex v in index order, `d0550(v)` runs:
1. If flag[v] < 2, skip.
2. **Removable** (`cf400`): for every live triangle around v, both other corners a and b need |n_v · n_a| ≥ factor. Unless flag[v] == 4, a neighbour whose flag isn't 1 or 4 must also have |y − y_v| ≤ tolerance (FLT_MAX, so this check never fails).
3. **Candidates** (`cfa40`): for every live triangle around v, each other corner w that passes `cf5c0(v, w)`. They're sorted by an MSVC `std::sort` comparator; the key appears to be distance to v in x/z (`FUN_180133020`, comparator in `FUN_180130020` and related), still to be confirmed. The first candidate is the target.
4. **`cf5c0(v, w)`**, flag rules:
   - flag 0 → never.
   - flag 3 → w must have flag 3 or 0.
   - flag 4 → w must have flag 4 or 1.
   - Otherwise any w.
   
   Then for every live triangle around v **and** around w, with v replaced by w:
   - If flag[w] > 1 and the triangle becomes degenerate, reject unless all three corners have flag ≥ 2.
   - Reject if `cf140` (the normalised edges' x/z cross product is < 0.1 in absolute value, i.e. nearly collinear).
   - Reject if `cf290` (any x/z edge is longer than L, or the x/z orientation cross is > 0).
5. **Collapse:** merge v's adjacency list into w's (`FUN_1800a6a00`), clear v's list, replace v by w in v's triangles, and zero any triangle that becomes degenerate.

**Compaction** (`cf7b0`): live triangles are kept in original order, called after every iteration. The log line is "X triangles merged to Y".

**After the merger:** the builder swaps the first two indices of every triangle, which flips the winding.

### Confirmed details (prototype `research/derived_maps/merger_proto.py`)

**Vertex flags** (grid lambda `FUN_18016b2f0`):
- The default is 2.
- A valid vertex gets 2 from `FUN_1801471b0` if all 8 neighbours one cell away (±DAT_1806b2c04 = extent / maxTiles × 0.5, i.e. one cell) are valid, and 0 otherwise.
- **Mesh-border vertex** (i or j is 0 or 223): the flag starts at 0. If exactly 3 of the 4 axis neighbours are valid (a map edge), it becomes 3, except at a multiple of 32 along that edge.
- **Sea option** (`param_1[10]`): vertices with (i & 3) == 0 or (j & 3) == 0 get 0.

**Height query** (`FUN_18016ae30`):
- Query the tiles near the point (terrain quadtree). Skip any whose tile set is `exclude_from_global_mesh` or whose `use_alt_lf` ≠ the mesh kind (sea meshes use alt lf).
- The first tile with valid `get_height` wins. Otherwise take the minimum over 4 diagonal probes (±DAT_180456360). With nothing valid, the result is −20 (a hole).
- Holes follow tile coverage. Example: the jagged hex edge on the south map border, where x mod 8 in 4..7 on rows 0–1.

**Normals:** Sobel ÷ (k² − 1) = ÷8 (`FUN_180134080` returns sum / (k·k − 1)), with nz = 1/0.33. So n = normalise(Sx/8, Sy/8, 3.0303).

**Grid positions:** x = f32(I × (double)f32(595.1) / 3568) with I the global column, **computed in double**. This is bit-exact on all columns. f32(I) × f32 cell is not.

**lf height** (`TERRAIN_RENDER_SETUP::get_height_worker` + bilinear `FUN_1803a1e30`):
- u = (x − minX)/(maxX − minX) and v = 1 − (z − minZ)/(maxZ − minZ).
- fx = u·W, fy = v·H. Top row = int((v − 1/H)·H), right column = int((u + 1/W)·W).
- Lerp columns by fx − floor(fx), then rows by fy − floor(fy).
- value = u16 × f32(1/65535).
- height = (l × 5500) × f − f × 1200, with f = (1/128) × tileSize (tileSize = 595.1/1784).
- The prototype reproduces vanilla vertex y bit-exactly on about 60% of vertices; the rest are mostly 2 ulps off. **Open.**

**Merger:**
- The input triangle count reproduces BOB's log exactly (99014 on mesh 0).
- With exact normals, flags and double-precision positions, the output matches vanilla's first 210 triangles.
- The prototype makes 8152 triangles against vanilla's 7191.
- The remaining causes are being narrowed down: hole validity (the prototype uses vanilla quad coverage, not real tile coverage) and exact heights.

### Still to do
- Vertex flags (`[rbp+0x58]` in the builder).
- `FUN_180147860` normals.
- `FUN_18016ae30` height.
- The `std::sort` comparator.
- VERTEX_LIST_CLEANER (`FUN_1800d0700`).
- Skirts: the builder code after the cleaner (lines 890–1300 of `180124ed0`, using 0.01 and 1.0 offsets).
- MESH_SPLITTER.
- The `land_mesh_N.compressed_map` writer.
- Sea meshes.

## main190 vs BOB, Frida-verified (2026-10-05)

BOB references: `output/bob_runs/frida_gmesh_main190_bob_terrain` and `frida_gcombo_main190_bob_terrain` (two runs, files identical apart from uninitialised bytes 0x148–0x14B, plus 0xA5–0xA7 on sea meshes). Dumps from `research/bob_re/frida_gmesh.js`, `frida_gmesh_combo.js`, `frida_gheight3.js` and `frida_gmerge_trace.js`; analysis scripts in `research/gmesh/`.

**Inputs.**
- With the main190 pack at type 4 (the lock protocol), BOB reads `lf_height_map`, `lf_sea_height_map` and `tile_list.bin` from that pack, not from the kit's working_data (they differ). Native runs against the pack's copies (`research/gmesh/extract_pack_inputs.py`) reproduce BOB's hole pattern exactly: 0 differing grid points over 310 meshes. The kit's copies give 292.
- The height query is `BobGlobalHeight` (FUN_18016ae30), the default since 2026-10-05 (`--global-mesh native` or `ATLAS3K_GMESH_BOB_HEIGHT=0` for the old path):
  - tiles with their tile set's `exclude_from_global_mesh` (read from `_tile_database/_settings.bin`) or a different `use_alt_lf` are skipped;
  - `use_alt_lf` is the tile record's last byte (generic_sea and sea only);
  - lf uses BOB's tile size T′ = (1/tilesW)·(tilesW·T), 0x3eaaca80 on main190, one ulp under 595.1/1784. The terrain bounds and the query grid step (maxTiles·T′)/(2·maxTiles) also use T′.
- Every hf map of the included tile sets is all zero, so the heights are lf only.
- Heights: bit-exact on 83.5% of the valid points (41 of 310 grids identical).
- **Open:** the tile order. FUN_18016ae30 takes the first answering tile in TERRAIN_QUAD_TREE order (`intersect_non_empty_nodes_gproj`: STATIC_QUADTREE nodes, tiles in insertion order). That is neither ascending nor descending tile-list order; see `research/gmesh/tile_order.py` on BOB's dump of mesh k = 170. Decompiles are in `research/bob_re/ws_tquad`.

**Merger inputs** (24 meshes dumped at TRIANGLE_MERGER::process):
- x/z (I·ext/total in double), y, flags (8 probes at ±cell; DAT_1806b2c04 = the cell, read from BOB) and normals are identical, as are the input triangle lists;
- the normals' second gradient (FUN_180134370) walks rows like the first, with the kernel transposed.

**TRIANGLE_MERGER:**
- 50 passes with step 64/50 = 1.28: FUN_18009b4d0 is max(64/6, 50), not min. This was found by a per-vertex trace of BOB against the native merger.
- Candidates are sorted with an MSVC `std::sort` port (`MsvcSort`).
- Fed BOB's height grids, the merged triangle lists are identical on 305 of 310 meshes. The other 5 are exactly the meshes whose grids differed in validity, so their flags differed.

**Byte-identical (2026-10-05).** The global_mesh step's default "bob" geometry reproduces all 494 main190 files of BOB's run (`output/bob_runs/frida_gmesh2_main190_bob`, 310 `.rigid_model_v2`, 184 `.compressed_map`), apart from the uninitialised bytes 0x148–0x14B and, on sea meshes, 0xA5–0xA7. `BobGlobalMeshTests` checks this; `--global-mesh native` keeps the earlier approximation.
- **Tile order:** TERRAIN_QUAD_TREE pre-order.
  - Root (−1, −1)..(maxX, maxZ); halve while T·16 < size, which gives depth 8 on main190.
  - Children (min x, max z), (max x, max z), (min x, min z), (max x, min z).
  - A tile sits in the leaf holding the centre of its rectangle; tiles inside a leaf keep tile-list order.
  - This fits 99.0% of BOB's multi-tile call sequences (`research/gmesh/tree_fit.py`). The rest are generic_sea tiles inside one leaf, which don't change any height.
- **Query coordinate** (FUN_18016b2f0): (i + i0) · (ext / total), with the step in **double**, ext = (float)(maxTiles · T′), rounded to float once. The float step is 1 ulp off on about 13% of rows; that was the remaining 13% of height mismatches (`research/gmesh/coord_fit.py`: 130,436/130,436 points of mesh k = 170). With it: 310/310 grids and 310/310 merged lists are bit-exact.
- **Skirts** (after VERTEX_LIST_CLEANER = the first-use renumbering):
  - Take every kept grid vertex with flag 0 or 3, row by row.
  - Walk +x, then +z, over vertices the cleaner dropped, to the next kept one. A hole on the way ends the x walk with n; it ends the z walk at the last dropped vertex (n if none). At row 0 / row n−1 (col 0 / col n−1 for z), a hole at the midpoint ±0.01 outside also ends the walk.
  - If the end vertex has flag 0 or 3 and the edge midpoint ±0.01 across it is a hole, emit four vertices (a, b, a − 1, b − 1) and indices 0 1 2 2 1 3 1 0 2 1 2 3.
  - Positions are the query coordinates.
- **Bounds:** x/z = ((1/total)·i0)·ext and ((cells + i0)/total)·ext in float; y = vertex extent.
- **Header:**
  - 0xA6 on land = the first digit of the mesh number (stale string memory, the same in both runs);
  - 0xE8–0xEF = 0 and 0xF0 = 9e d4.
- **land_mesh_N.compressed_map:** WARSCAPE::rasterise_max_heights of the final mesh (skirts included) into an n × n field filled with −50.
  - u = (x − minX)/(maxX − minX)·n, likewise v, through an identity matrix.
  - Same per-triangle rasteriser as the river height patches.
  - u16 = trunc((h − lo)·(1/(hi − lo))·65535), header (0, lo, 0, 0, hi, 0).
- MESH_SPLITTER never splits on main190 (all meshes are under 65,536 vertices).
